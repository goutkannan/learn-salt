## Software installation

Some of the lesson material in this project (especially the home index)
is in MarkDown format.  The GitHub web site automatically converts MarkDown
(.md) files to html, so that you can read them in your browser.

When you download the project to your own workstation, you will not have that help.
You will want to load an addon to your browser.  

For [Firefox]() use 
[MarkDown Viewer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-viewer/)

For [Chrome] try
[MarkDown Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-reader/gpoigdifkoadgajcincpilkjmejcaanc/reviews?hl=en)

To install a native MarkDown reader/editor on your workstation, try
[ReText](https://github.com/retext-project/retext).
